## With terraform you use a 'resource' block to define the resource that must be created on Azure.
## The resource block takes a resource type and a name.
## Then you need to specify all parameters that are required for the resource.
## For a resource group on Azure you need to specify the location and the name.
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "group" {
  location = "westeurope"
  name     = "rg-challenge-3"
}

## Message for the Dominus: "Complete the blocks below which will create an App Service Plan and the App Service."


locals {
  team_id = "42679"
}

## An App Service Plan mainly defines the hardware that is used to host your App Service.
## https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/app_service_plan

## Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. 
## It also allows to use Docker containers to run your applications.

## Use the documentation to deploy the docker image: mvandep3/htf:latest
